# Connext DDS

RTI Connext DDS is a software connectivity framework for real-time distributed
applications. It provides the middleware communications service that
programmers need to distribute time-critical data between embedded and/or
enterprise devices or nodes. Connext DDS uses a publish-subscribe
communications model to make data-distribution efficient and robust. Connext
DDSalso supports the Request-Reply communication pattern1.

Connext DDS implements the Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe (DCPS) API of the
OMG’s specification, Data Distribution Service (DDS) for Real-Time Systems. DDS
is the first standard developed for the needs of real-time systems, providing
an efficient way to transfer data in a distributed system. With Connext DDS,
you begin your development with a fault-tolerant and flexible communications
infrastructure that will work over a wide variety of computer hardware,
operating systems, languages, and networking transport protocols. Connext DDS
is highly configurable, so programmers can adapt it to meet an application’s
specific communication requirements.

In this directory you will find some examples about Connext DDS. For more info
