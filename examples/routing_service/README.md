# Routing Service

RTI Routing Service is an out-of-the-box solution for integrating disparate and
geographically dispersed systems. It scales RTI Connext DDS applications across
domains, LANs and WANs, including firewall and NAT traversal. It also supports
DDS-to-DDS bridging by allowing you to make transformations in the data along
the way. This allows unmodified DDS applications to communicate even if they
were developed using incompatible interface definitions. This is often the case
when integrating new and legacy applications or independently developed
systems. Using RTI Routing Service Adapter SDK, you can extend Routing Service
to interface with non-DDS systems using off-the-shelf or custom developed
adapters.

In this directory you will find some examples about the Routing Service.
